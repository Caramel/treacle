Welcome to treacle's documentation!
===================================

treacle is an AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface) script which handles
public holidays and opening hours in different offices with different
timezones and different public holidays.

This allows conditional call routing in Asterisk, and also allows one
system to route calls for different time zones and different offices.

This means if you have callers in Adelaide and callers in Melbourne, you
can give each a different number, and their calls will be routed to
voicemail after hours in their timezone, and not available on public
holidays in their timezone.
